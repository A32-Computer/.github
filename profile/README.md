# A32 Computer
A32 is a 32 bit CPU (actually, it can be considered the whole computer), featuring 32 registers (a lot) and a custom ISA, made for simplicity and ease of design.
This organization holds all the official projects that target A32 or are a part of the computer itself, like compilers, the CPU and more.
